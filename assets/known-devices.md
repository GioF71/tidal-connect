# Known devices

## Preface

This is a list of devices that are known to be working with this application, and can be easily configure by just using the variables CARD_NAME, CARD_FORMAT and, in a very limited set of cases, CARD_DEVICE.  
Other audio devices can be used with the provided presets via ASOUND_FILE_PREFIX (the available configurations are in the userconfig folder of the repository).  
For devices known through user issues, I assume that software volume works unless we know that it doesn't. Feel free to open issues in order to correct/enrich the following table with even more devices.
