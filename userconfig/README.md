# Samples

The files you find here are sample `asound.conf` configuration files with the hardware configurations I have run tidal-connect on, or that user have tested successfully.  
Choose one that matches your hardware (if any), or create a new one. Follow a synthax <ASOUND_FILE_PREFIX>.asound.conf, then set ASOUND_FILE_PREFIX to that prefix.  
Example, in order to select a file name `topping-d10-softvol.asound.conf", set ASOUND_FILE_PREFIX to `topping-d10-softvol`.
